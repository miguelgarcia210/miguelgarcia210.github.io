                    I'm <span class="about-dev-name">Miguel Garcia</span>, and I'm a software developer.

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion for software development has grown immensely compared to when I
                developed my first 'Hello World!' project and today. My journey began with a curious mindset on how
                developers were able to create programs that others could use around the world. This baffled me but
                intrigued me the most because of the sole thought of being able to develop anything I could vision. Any
                idea I had or any “wouldn’t it be great if…” thought, could potentially be turned into a reality by
                developing the program to do just what I had in mind. The bridge between our creative minds and the
                digital world is a vast space filled with opportunity and I knew my ambition was to learn how I can
                create my own bridges and bring my visions to reality in this ever changing digital world.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-desc hidden">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I yearned to learn how new technologies enabled us to communicate to the digital
                world and so I began searching for sources of information so I may begin to educate myself. I began
                downloading mobile applications and reading books to learn syntactical skills and basic fundamentals of
                any language I was interested in. During my collegiate academia, I began to transition into Computer
                Science as my field of study. Unfortunately, my collegiate education came to a halt due to family
                hardships and as a result I settled back in my hometown. I quickly obtained a job and though it was not
                in my desired field, I continued to focus on my programming skills and found interest in web
                development. I acquired educational books in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fortunately, my occupation
                allotted an hour for lunch and I would eat my meal while I continued my readings. Questions would arise
                occasionally as to what I was reading and I would explain what language the book was based on and it’s
                purpose. I enjoyed answering these questions because it allowed me to evaluate myself on how well I was
                retaining the information and if my understandings were well enough to explain it’s functionality.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-desc hidden">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some time, I relocated to a nearby city to further my education. I believe
                plans are great because they give a sense of motivation and drive to reach your ultimate goal at the end
                of your plan. However, plans don’t always go accordingly and I’ve come to realize this over time. My
                intentions were to attend college in the fall and continue to pursue my degree in Computer Science. This
                seemed to be my straightforward path to follow. Then one day I came across an ad of a coding boot camp
                named <span class="codeup-name">Code<span>up</span></span>. My options soon doubled and I took a huge
                leap and applied for their Full Stack Web Development Program. Fortunately, I was accepted into the
                program and I was soon to begin practicing and advancing my skills as a developer in a professional
                setting. I quickly adapted to their rigorous, fast-paced curriculum and enjoyed every frustrating
                syntactical error, type error, and all the others that occurred during my developmental projects. I
                created bonds with others passionate about programming and their future as a developer through
                individual developments and pair programming projects. Each one of us entered as strangers but then
                graduated with skills, knowledge, and close friends. I am grateful for this journey I endured and
                continue to practice my skills and learn new technologies for future implementations.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="p-about-desc hidden">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next journey is never certain but there will always be options to be
                considered. Some may appear far in the distance in comparison to others, but I believe a little faith in
                the decision you choose makes a powerful difference. I have always been a software developer at heart
                and I know my limits based on my skills and knowledge which is why I persist my studies to improve.
                Software development is dynamic and challenges me to continue to engage myself into my passion. By
                leveraging my skills, I’m able to make conceptual thoughts a reality and continue to express myself
                through code in this world. I encourage you to continue pursuing your passion and I hope it brings you
                joy. The same joy my passion has done for me. I am <span class="about-dev-name">Miguel Garcia</span> and
                I am a software developer who enjoys bridging the connection from our creative minds to our digital
                world.<br>
